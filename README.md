# Big-Data-Project
DS 1004

This is the final project of DS-GA1004: Discover Composite keys.

This project is trying to find out an efficient approach that could identify minimal composite key in the data collection with the use of Gordian algorithm. Detailed methodology and corresponding results would be presented in next sections.
