# Big-Dasta-Project
DS 1004

This is the final project of DS-GA1004: Discover Composite keys.

This project is trying to find out an efficient approach that could identify minimal composite key in the data collection with the use of 
\textit{Gordian algorithm}. Detailed methodology and corresponding results would be presented in next sections.
